            <h2>Arcane Creators</h2>
            <h3>Alex Yee & Christian Linke</h3>
            <p>It's hard to answer how we did it, but at the end of the day, the most important thing was just to tell a good story, and we felt like a good story wouldn't require you to come in with knowledge in advance. We spent a lot of time trying to strike a balance of setting up characters and trying to find ways to keep that setup engaging and suspenseful, even though for a lot of players, they're like, 'I know where they're going to wind up.'' As for why we decided to make it more accessible. I think for a lot of us who have played League for a really long time, a lot of our friends and family have no idea what the game's world is. So, we really wanted players to be able to share the world they've been spending so much time in with people around them, and have this way of having a conversation with people outside of the League fandom.</p>

			<h2>Riot Games</h2>
			<p>Riot Games, Inc. is an American video game developer, publisher and esports tournament organizer based in Los Angeles, California. It was founded in September 2006 by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill to develop League of Legends and went on to develop several spin-off games and the unrelated first-person shooter game Valorant. In 2011, Riot Games was acquired by Chinese conglomerate Tencent. Riot Games' publishing arm, Riot Forge, oversees the production of League of Legends spin-offs by other developers. The company worked with Fortiche to release Arcane, a television series based on the League of Legends universe. Riot Games operates 14 international League of Legends esports leagues, the League of Legends World Championship and the Valorant Champions Tour. The company, which had 24 offices worldwide as of 2018, sells corporate sponsorships, merchandise, and streaming rights for its leagues.</p>

		<h2>The Cast</h2>

					<h3>Vi</h3>
					<p>Vi is one of the many characters who populate Arcane's disadvantaged Undercity. Voiced by Hailee Steinfeld, she resents growing up in the shadow of Piltover, being seen as trash by their ruling class. After suffering repeated humiliations at the hands of Piltovers, Vi wishes to fight them so that her younger sister and the rest of the Undercity can prosper. As time passes and the sources of the Undercity's problems become more complex, so does Vi's mission.</p>

					<span class="hover-text-title">Ella Purnell</span>
					<h3>Jinx</h3>
					<p>One character that the creators knew would be challenging to portray is marksman Jinx because she has a distinct, wild Harley Quinn personality that comes off strongly in-game. Alex was particularly impressed with Ella Purnell's performance. “We all know who she is in the game,” he said. “But we really wanted to bring this extra dimension to her to see this subtly and true human behind the big, bright flashy exterior of Jinx, and I think Ella was real fine in that.”</p>

					<span class="hover-text-title">Mia Sinclair Jenness</span>
					<h3>Powder</h3>
					<p> The easiest thing about playing Powder for me is how fiercely loyal and loving she is towards her family. For me, the people that I care about come first in my life, 100%. And it's the same thing with Powder, so that was super easy for me. But what was more difficult was the fact that she is so resilient. I think of myself as a pretty resilient person, but Powder is faced with some circumstances that I don't think I would be able to handle. So tapping into that side of myself and thinking about, "If I were in the situation, how would I be reacting?" versus "How would Powder be reacting?" That was definitely a cool learning experience for me.</p>

					<h3>Caitlyn</h3>
					<p>It seems like Katie Leung was destined to play the role of Caitlyn. She first auditioned for the role in the United Kingdom. “This was my first voice casting and I didn't know what to expect,” Katie Leung shared with ONE Esports. “I remember going up for it in London.” After some time, she received an invitation from Riot Games to do a second interview. She was staying in Los Angeles, California when she got the callback, which was fortunate since the Riot Games headquarters is based in the same city.</p>

						<h3>Jayce</h3>
						<p>"I went for the role of Jayce, like that was it," Kevin said. "Coming from a working class background and rising up to help Piltover, to help his friends, to help the people that surround him...I could understand that journey. I just loved Jayce's entire emotional arc and was like that's my guy, that's who I want to be."</p>

						<span class="hover-text-title">Harry Lloyd</span>
						<h3>Viktor</h3>
						<p>"I did get more and more into the whole folklore and reading kind of fantasy stories and stuff about Viktor specifically, because his whole story and his mysterious backstory already had quite a lot of different versions already out there. So I was definitely interested in that, more out of curiosity than anything that I think would directly affect how we were doing it."</p>

						<h3>Silco</h3>
						<p>Silco's voice actor Jason Spisak became involved with “Arcane” during its second year of production. At that time, there were absolutely no visual assets for actors to use as a reference, and complications from COVID-19 prevented some of the actors from meeting and recording in person. “I'd never met Ella, the actress who plays Jinx, at all until the premiere,” Spisak said. “It'll blow your noodle when you think about all the scenes we did together and our interactions.”</p>

						<h3>Vander</h3>
						<p>JB Blanc is a French-British actor and director. He portrayed Vander, a former brutal fist fighter whose strength was reserved for the fight of equality between the Undercity and Piltover, who progressed into a widely respected peace-promoter and the adoptive father of sisters Vi and Jinx.</p>
